## 1. Check commands in `.bashrc`

Before installing, it's recommended to check whether the commands used in `.bashrc` exist on your system:

```sh
make checkcmd
```

This helps ensure there wonâ€™t be missing command errors after applying the configuration.

---

## 2. Backup existing configuration

Back up your current configuration files before installing:

```sh
make backup
```

This command backs up the following files to `~/.dotfiles_backup`:

- `.bashrc`
- `.bash_profile`
- `.vimrc`
- `.vim/` (directory)

---

## 3. Install configurations

Install both `bash` and `vim` configurations:

```sh
make install
```

To install only the `bash` configurations:

```sh
make bash
```

To install only the `vim` configurations:

```sh
make vim
```

---

## 4. Clean up

Remove the installed symbolic links:

```sh
make clean
```
